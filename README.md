[![Build and Test](https://github.com/brobeson/vscode-lizard/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brobeson/vscode-lizard/actions/workflows/main.yaml)

This is an extension for Visual Studio Code to run
[Lizard](https://github.com/terryyin/lizard) cyclomatic complexity analysis on
your project.

## Features

This extension reports diagnostics for functions that:

- are too long,
- have too many parameters, or
- have too many branches.

You can enable the metrics and specify their limits in your VS Code settings.

- VS Code Lizard cannot scan a file during editing. Lizard reads the file from
  disk, so you must save your changes which triggers scanning the file.
- VS Code Lizard only supports C++. I will add support for other languages as
  soon as possible.
